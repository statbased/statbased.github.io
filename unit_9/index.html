<h2>Reflections</h2>

<h3>Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?</h3>
<p>I looked at a number of portfolios centered around illustration, art and comics but I modelled it after The Oatmeal in particular. It's a little busy but the target audience is willing to explore because there's a lot of little nooks and crannies of humor and imagery.</p>

<h3>Which parts of the design are you most proud of?</h3>
<p>I feel I made the experience quite different on each device. There are also a few hints at finesse which I find promising, such as the delayed background transformation on button presses. I'm also proud that this process is becoming kind of like sketching to me.. I finished at a reasonably quick pace without much interruption.</p>

<h3>What struggles did you encounter in your design process?</h3>
<p>I winged the color scheme and it looks very dated. I also did not plan for ipad, that was done on the fly.</p>

<h3>What struggles did you encounter during page development?</h3>
<p>I definitely still get confused about nesting. I'm going to work closely on this with my mentor in the remaining sessions.</p>

<h3>What did you learn from making your project responsive?</h3>
<p>I learned that your page can get really messed up if you don't test it thoroughly and on multiple devices.</p>


<h2>Step 2: Reviews</h2>
<h3>Group 1</h3>
<a>http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/</a>

<h3>layout</h3>
<p>Very sleek, simple, easy to navigate, easy to use, high contrast with simple graphic elements.</p>

<h3>typography</h3>
<p>Sparing, bold and high contrast. This is a site where the photographs are the heroes. Also, very formal.</p>

<h3>navigation</h3>
<p>Navigation is always accessible no matter where you go or how far down you scroll.</p>

<h3>overall flow</h3>
<p>Very easy to follow. To the point. No extraneous elements whatsoever.</p>

<h3>Space Jam</h3>

<p>It is a tremendous indictment of my sense of taste and style that I quite like this page.
It is a guilty pleasure. I feel, though, that it is missing a midi file playing on loop.
Maybe even give each page their own distinct midi song. <p>
